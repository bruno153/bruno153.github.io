## Kids these days

> The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; 
> they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. 
> Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. 
> They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, 
> chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs,
> and tyrannize their teachers.

Atributed to Socrates by Plato, according to  William L. Patty and Louise S. Johnson in 
*Personality and Adjustment*.

When I was your age, children knew to respect their parents. We didn’t give anyone any lip. 
We owned up to our responsibilities. We took advantage of our opportunities. We knew what 
was what. Kids these days have gotten everything all messed up. Kids these days just aren’t 
what they used to be. Kids these days.

In 2000, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett proposed the existence of a new stage of development: 
emerging adulthood. Whereas before, we’d go straight from adolescence to full-blown young 
adultdom, now, there was a step in between, an area where our adult selves were emerging 
but not-quite-emerged. The advances of modern industrialized societies had been pushing 
adult-defining choices—marriage, children, and the like—further and further into the 
twenties and thirties, and as a result, we no longer had to grow up as quickly as we once 
did. We could instead indulge in a newly created stage of development.
